                <p class="lead m-4">
                At a high level, IPFS is a way to store and share files in a decentralized manner. This means that instead of relying on a central server to store and distribute files, IPFS uses a network of nodes to store pieces of files across the network. When a user requests a file, IPFS retrieves the pieces from multiple nodes and reassembles them, allowing the user to access the file.
                It is an open-source protocol, so anyone can use, modify and contribute to its development</p>
